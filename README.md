# Face Detection

This little project uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in an image.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV

## Instalation

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip by running the following command:

`pip install opencv-python`

## Usage

To run the face recognition script, simply navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

`python face_recognition.py`

## Note

The script is using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file, which is a classifier that can detect faces using the Haar Cascade method.
